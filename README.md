# `ts-calculator`

A little experiment to implement some basic arithmetic using only the Typescript type system. The Typescript type system is known to be turing complete, so why not?

The project has a `package.json` but the only dependency is the typescript compiler. If you have that system wide, you may not even need to install it.
